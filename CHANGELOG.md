## [Unreleased]


## [1.7.0] - 2020-10-15
### Added
- Feature to limit the maximum number of rows to keep in the log table. Use `set_max_table_rows()` method on the handler instance to configure the limit.

### Improved
- README.md now has a section about v2 and v1 differences.

## [1.6.5] - 2020-04-11
### Fixed
- Limitations of WordPressHandler regarding formatters, whereas formatted data was only respected in the 'extra' part of the records, but not for 'message' or 'context' (https://github.com/bradmkjr/monolog-wordpress/issues/11). **Note:** the time column still does not follow the formatted datetime to keep compatibility with existing deployments.

## [1.6.4] - 2020-04-11
### Fixed
- Previous Fix in v.1.6.3 broke compatibility with Monolog v1 and PHP versions before 7.1. Monolog v2 compatibility will be reintroduced in v2 of this package.

### Improved
- PHP v5.3 compatibility made explicit in composer.json
- Added Wordpress as a development requirement
- WordPressHandler::$wpdb type declaration was incorrect in PHPDoc, set to \wpdb to point to the correct class in Wordpress

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md

## [1.6.3] - 2019-11-12
### Fixed
- Added ` quotes around additional and extra fields. This fixes issue when an extra/additional field is tried to be defined using a reserved SQL keyword as name. Example: "procedure" will cause "WordPress database error" written directly to the admin UI, and indeed failure to create logging table.
- Fixed Fatal error: Declaration of WordPressHandler\WordPressHandler->write(array $record) must be compatible with that of Monolog\Handler\AbstractProcessingHandler->write(array $record): void

### Reverted
- It was a mistake taking out extra fields, added back in

## [1.6.2] - 2017-05-26
### Reverted
- It was a mistake taking out extra fields, added back in

## [1.6.1] - 2017-05-26 [YANKED]
### Removed
- $extraFields was duplication of $additionalFields, so have removed it

## [1.6.0] - 2017-05-26
